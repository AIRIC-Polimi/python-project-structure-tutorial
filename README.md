# Python project structure tutorial

This repository has been created to serve as an example of how to structure a python repository for an AI/ML project. All ML code is taken and freely adapted from the [ML From Scratch](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/ML-From-Scratch) project. The current `starting-point` branch provides the basics: a raw `requirements.txt` file, a couple of python scripts that simulate typical ML code, this README and some data. During the tutorial several concepts will be shown, such as how to use a virtual environment, how to use a package manager to manage dependencies, how to structure project folders and imports, how to manage configuration, how to setup logging and how to package the code in a standalone module.

Feel free to go to the [main](https://github.com/TommasoBianchi/python-project-structure-tutorial/tree/main) branch to see the final form of the repo, or to browse through [tags](https://github.com/TommasoBianchi/python-project-structure-tutorial/tags) to see some of the intermediate results.
